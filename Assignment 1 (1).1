    "pass by value\n",
    "\n",
    "by default, all the parameters(arguments) are passed by reference to the functions thus, it you change the value of the \n",
    "parameter within a function the change is reflected in the calling function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "The pass by value is that whenever we pass the arguments to functions that are of type say numbers, strings, tuples. \n",
    " this is because of the immutable nature of them.\n",

    "            \n",
    "            shallow copy : creates copy of the object but rather than copying the elements of object it copies the\n",
    "                refernces to thier memory address any change made to the copy reflects in the original\n",
    "                \n",
    "21.What are local variables and global variables in Python?\n",
    "   Global Variables:\n",

    "\n",
    "Local Variables:\n",
    "Any variable declared inside a function is known as a local variable.\n",
    "This variable is present in the local space and not in the global space.\n",
